                <h2>What is Design Like Mad?</h2>
                <h4>Only the best thing since swatches!</h4>
                <p>
                    Design Like Mad is an organization that hosts 12-hour "design marathons" in different cities throughout the country.  These events bring together student and professional designers for 12 hours to provide pro-bono, design work for deserving, local non-profit organizations.  <br/><br/>
                    The first Design Like Mad event took place on December, 7th 2013 at the Madison Central Library.  We had 60 graphic designers, 6 architects, 5 interior designers, and 14 developers representing 20 non-profit organizations assembled in the Madison Public Library ready to get going. 
                    <br /><br />These teams worked on projects such as logo design, business cards, letterheads, website development, marketing and promotional materials, interior design, and architecture. The work they produced over 12 hours was truly astonishing and can be seen at designlikemad.org/projects. All food and necessary supplies were provided by donations from 14 local sponsors.

                <h4>2. Meet your Team</h4>
                    <p>We will put together teams based on ability of designers and the needs of the non-profit.  Designers will have the opportunity to rank their top three choices of projects, and we will try our very best to get you one of those teams.  
    <br /><br />One of the goals of Design Like Mad is to foster collaboration between designers who wouldnâ€™t normally work together.  For this reason, we do not take requests for teammates.  Teams are assigned randomly based on skill level and type of design.

                    <p><strong>Teams will meet 1 week prior to the event for a Networking/Project Planning Kickoff Bash!</strong>  Refreshments will be provided as teams get together and scope out projects with their non-profit representative.  No work will be completed at pre-planning meeting, teams will decide on a plan of action for the Design Like Mad event so they are prepared to start work immediately on the day of the event.  <strong>This meeting is mandatory for all participants and non-profit representatives.</strong>
